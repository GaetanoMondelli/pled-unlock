# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for implementing a visual tokenization template editor that replicates and enhances the functionality demonstrated in the tokenization_demo. The system will allow users to create, edit, and simulate token flow diagrams using drag-and-drop components that represent different stages of a tokenization pipeline.

The template editor will enable users to build complex tokenization workflows by connecting various component types (Sources, Queues, Processors, Aggregators, Sinks) and simulate the flow of tokens through the system with complete audit trails and blockchain-like ledger functionality.

The implementation must follow the proven patterns from the working tokenization_demo simulation, use the existing scenario.json as the default template, and avoid the errors encountered in previous attempts. The system must be elegant, simple, and provide proper message interface definitions for type-safe component communication.

## Requirements
