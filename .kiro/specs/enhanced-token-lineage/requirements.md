# Enhanced Token Lineage Requirements

## Introduction

The current token lineage system shows basic ancestry but lacks the detailed genealogy needed for complete traceability. Users need to see the complete story of every token - from its ultimate source origins through every aggregation, transformation, and processing step. When tokens are aggregated, users must be able to explore the full history of each contributing token back to the original data sources.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Complete Token Genealogy Tree

**User Story:** As a user analyzing token flow, I want to see a complete genealogy tree for any token that traces back to all original data sources, so that I can understand the complete provenance of any value in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on any token THEN the system SHALL display a complete genealogy tree showing all ancestor tokens back to original sources
2. WHEN a token is created through aggregation THEN the system SHALL show all contributing tokens and their individual lineages
3. WHEN I expand any ancestor token in the tree THEN the system SHALL show its complete lineage back to sources
4. IF a token has multiple source paths THEN the system SHALL display all paths clearly differentiated
5. WHEN viewing token genealogy THEN the system SHALL show the transformation/aggregation operation that created each generation

### Requirement 2: Interactive Token History Navigation

**User Story:** As a user investigating token provenance, I want to click on any token in a lineage tree to explore its individual history, so that I can drill down into specific branches of the genealogy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I click on any token in the genealogy tree THEN the system SHALL open that token's detailed history view
2. WHEN viewing a token's history THEN the system SHALL show all events that affected that specific token
3. WHEN I navigate between related tokens THEN the system SHALL maintain context of the original investigation
4. WHEN viewing aggregated tokens THEN the system SHALL show clickable links to all source tokens used in the aggregation
5. WHEN I return from a detailed view THEN the system SHALL restore my position in the original genealogy tree

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Aggregation Event Details

**User Story:** As a user analyzing aggregation operations, I want to see detailed information about which specific tokens were aggregated and their individual contributions, so that I can understand how aggregated values were computed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing an aggregation event THEN the system SHALL list all source tokens with their IDs, values, and origin nodes
2. WHEN an aggregation occurs THEN the system SHALL record the specific operation (sum, average, etc.) and show the calculation
3. WHEN I view aggregation details THEN the system SHALL show the timestamp and node that performed the aggregation
4. WHEN tokens are aggregated THEN the system SHALL preserve the complete lineage of each contributing token
5. WHEN displaying aggregation results THEN the system SHALL show both the final result and the breakdown of contributions

### Requirement 4: Source Token Attribution

**User Story:** As a user tracking data flow, I want to see which original data source tokens contributed to any derived token and in what proportion, so that I can understand the ultimate origin of all values.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing any token THEN the system SHALL show all original source tokens that contributed to its value
2. WHEN multiple sources contribute THEN the system SHALL show the proportional contribution of each source
3. WHEN sources are combined through multiple steps THEN the system SHALL trace the complete path from each source
4. WHEN displaying source attribution THEN the system SHALL show the original source node names and token creation timestamps
5. WHEN a token has complex lineage THEN the system SHALL provide a summary view showing only the ultimate sources and their contributions

### Requirement 5: Visual and Tabular Lineage Representation

**User Story:** As a user exploring token relationships, I want to see both visual tree/graph and tabular representations of token lineage, so that I can choose the most appropriate view for my analysis and documentation needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing token lineage THEN the system SHALL provide both visual tree and tabular view options
2. WHEN in visual mode THEN the system SHALL display a tree showing parent-child relationships with convergent lines for multiple parents
3. WHEN in tabular mode THEN the system SHALL show lineage as a structured table with columns for generation, token ID, value, operation, source tokens, and timestamps
4. WHEN displaying lineage THEN the system SHALL use different visual styles/icons for different operation types (creation, aggregation, transformation)
5. WHEN the lineage is complex THEN the visual mode SHALL provide zoom and pan capabilities, while tabular mode SHALL support sorting and grouping
6. WHEN viewing large lineages THEN both modes SHALL support collapsing/expanding branches or sections to manage complexity
7. WHEN switching between views THEN the system SHALL maintain the current selection and expansion state

### Requirement 6: Lineage Search and Filtering

**User Story:** As a user working with complex token flows, I want to search and filter token lineages to focus on specific sources, operations, or time periods, so that I can efficiently analyze relevant portions of the genealogy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing token lineage THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality to find specific tokens or nodes
2. WHEN I apply filters THEN the system SHALL show only lineage branches matching the criteria
3. WHEN filtering by source THEN the system SHALL highlight all tokens derived from specific data sources
4. WHEN filtering by operation type THEN the system SHALL show only tokens created through specific operations (aggregation, transformation, etc.)
5. WHEN filtering by time period THEN the system SHALL show only tokens and operations within the specified timeframe

### Requirement 7: Lineage Export and Documentation

**User Story:** As a user documenting token provenance, I want to export complete lineage information in various formats, so that I can share and document the complete audit trail of token origins.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I request lineage export THEN the system SHALL generate a complete genealogy report
2. WHEN exporting lineage THEN the system SHALL include all token IDs, values, timestamps, and operations
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, visual diagram)
4. WHEN exporting complex lineages THEN the system SHALL maintain the hierarchical structure in the export
5. WHEN sharing lineage data THEN the system SHALL include sufficient metadata for external analysis
