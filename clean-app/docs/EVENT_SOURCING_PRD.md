# Product Requirements Document: Event Sourcing Architecture

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the architecture and implementation strategy for transforming the current simulation system into a comprehensive Event Sourcing platform. The core value proposition is enabling **deterministic replay** of complex multi-agent systems through immutable event logs, providing both debugging capabilities and tokenization opportunities for value creation.

## Vision Statement

Build a universal event sourcing framework that captures, stores, and replays all system events with perfect fidelity, enabling time-travel debugging, state reconstruction at any point, and monetization through event-based tokenization.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Event Sourcing Fundamentals

**Event**: An immutable record of something that happened in the system
- Timestamp (microsecond precision)
- Event Type
- Source Node/Agent
- Payload (strongly typed)
- Metadata (correlation IDs, causality chains)
- Cryptographic hash for integrity

**Event Store**: Append-only log of all events
- Never modified, only appended
- Single source of truth
- Supports partitioning by execution/scenario
- Enables parallel replay streams

**State Projection**: Current state derived from event replay
- State is always computable from events
- Multiple projections possible from same events
- Snapshot optimization for performance

### 2. Deterministic Replay

**Requirements for Determinism**:
1. **Pure Functions**: All event processors must be side-effect free
2. **Controlled Time**: Virtual time system, no wall-clock dependencies
3. **Seeded Randomness**: Reproducible random number generation
4. **External Event Injection**: Controlled points for external data entry
5. **Versioned Processors**: Event processor versioning for backward compatibility

**Replay Modes**:
- **Full Replay**: Process all events from genesis
- **Partial Replay**: Start from snapshot, replay subset
- **Branching Replay**: Fork execution at any point
- **Parallel Replay**: Multiple timelines from same base

### 3. External Event Integration

**Event Sources**:
- User interactions (UI events)
- API calls
- Webhook deliveries
- Timer/scheduled events
- System notifications
- External data feeds

**Event Normalization**:
- Convert external events to canonical format
- Timestamp alignment
- Correlation tracking
- Idempotency handling

### Key Components

#### 1. Event Store Interface
```typescript
interface EventStore {
  append(event: Event): Promise<EventId>
  getEvents(from: Timestamp, to: Timestamp): AsyncIterator<Event>
  getEventsByNode(nodeId: NodeId, from: Timestamp): AsyncIterator<Event>
  createSnapshot(timestamp: Timestamp): Promise<SnapshotId>
  loadSnapshot(snapshotId: SnapshotId): Promise<State>
}
```

#### 2. Event Replay Engine
```typescript
interface ReplayEngine {
  replay(events: Event[]): State
  replayFrom(snapshot: Snapshot, events: Event[]): State
  branch(baseState: State, newEvents: Event[]): State
  validateDeterminism(events: Event[]): ValidationResult
}
```

#### 3. External Event Gateway
```typescript
interface EventGateway {
  ingest(externalEvent: any): Event
  normalize(source: EventSource, data: any): Event
  correlate(event: Event, previousEvents: Event[]): CorrelationChain
  deduplicate(event: Event): boolean
}
```

## Token Economics & Value Creation

### Tokenization Strategy

**Event Tokens**: Each significant event can be tokenized
- Creation cost based on computational complexity
- Value appreciation through usage/reference
- Transferable ownership rights

**Execution Tokens**: Complete execution runs as NFTs
- Unique execution fingerprints
- Reproducible states with proof
- Valuable for testing/validation

**State Tokens**: Specific state configurations
- Interesting edge cases
- Test scenarios
- Training data for ML models

### Value Prioritization Framework

1. **Rarity Score**: How unique/unusual is this event sequence?
2. **Replay Value**: How often is this sequence replayed?
3. **Fork Potential**: How many branches stem from this state?
4. **Complexity Score**: Computational cost to reach this state
5. **Coverage Value**: What test coverage does this provide?

3. **Storage explosion**: Compression, archival strategies

### Business Risks
1. **Low token adoption**: Education, incentive programs
2. **Value discovery**: Market making, initial liquidity
3. **Regulatory concerns**: Legal review, compliance framework

## Open Questions for Discussion

1. **Event Granularity**: What constitutes a "significant" event worth storing?
2. **Retention Policy**: How long to keep events? Archive strategy?
3. **Privacy Concerns**: How to handle PII in events?
4. **Monetization Model**: Subscription vs pay-per-replay vs token economy?
5. **Integration Points**: Which external systems to prioritize?

## Conclusion

The Event Sourcing architecture transforms our simulation platform into a powerful debugging and value creation tool. By capturing every system event immutably and enabling perfect replay, we provide unprecedented visibility into system behavior while creating new monetization opportunities through tokenization.

The deterministic replay capability alone justifies the architectural investment, as it eliminates entire classes of bugs and enables time-travel debugging. The tokenization layer adds a compelling business model that aligns user incentives with platform growth.

## Next Steps

1. Review and validate determinism requirements
2. Define event schema standards
3. Implement Phase 1 persistence layer
4. Create replay proof-of-concept
5. Design token economics model
